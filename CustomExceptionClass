// First of all I have created my own custom exception class 
public class ProductNotFoundException extends Exception {
	 
    public ProductNotFoundException(String message) {
        super(message);
    }
}

// I have created one department class which stores the information about the departments
public class Department {
int DepartmentID = 1235857;
{
System.out.println("Student Id:" +DepartmentID);
}
}

// Now I have created another class named Store Manager for searching the product of the department hence we can see that a custom exception used is nothing different than built-in exception:
public class StoreManager {
	 
    public Department find(String DepartmentID) throws ProductNotFoundException {
        if (DepartmentID.equals("1236463")) {
            return new Department();
        } else {
            throw new ProductNotFoundException(
                "Could not find product having DepartmentID " + DepartmentID);
        }
    }
}

// Now I have written the code which handles the exception
import java.lang.*;

public class DepartmentStore {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        StoreManager manager = new StoreManager();
 
        try {
 
            Department DepartmentID = manager.find("1248759");
 
        } 
        catch (ProductNotFoundException ex) {
            System.err.print(ex);
        }
    }
}
